Hello, I am Ansuman Nayak, a software developer with expertise in database management, data analysis, visualization, and version control tools. I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Instrumentation from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2022.
<br><br>
I have experience as a ServiceNow analyst at KPMG, specifically working with the ITSM module, which has honed my analytical and problem-solving skills. My proficiency lies in MySQL, Tableau, Python, Javascript, and SQL among others. I am now pursuing my interest in the field of data science and engineering. 
<br><br>
When my hands start cramping from typing on the keyboard for too long, I like to pick up a paintbrush to experiment with colors on a canvas or a spatula to relax and cook. 
<br><br>
Currently, I am looking to utilize my skills and experience as a database engineer to develop and maintain high-performance databases. I am driven to create things and find solutions that have a positive influence on people's lives, and I am constantly interested in picking up new skills and technologies for accomplishing this. You can be reach out to me via email at <ansuman.nayak03@gmail.com>.
